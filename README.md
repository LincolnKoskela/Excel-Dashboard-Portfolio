## AboutME
Created by Lincoln Koskela — I’ve been experimenting with spreadsheets for over five years, tracking everything from my Honda Civic and Kawasaki Z500 to work, rent, expenses, and subscriptions. If it can be measured, I’ve probably logged it. I love transforming everyday data into visual insights that tell a story.
I’m currently an IT and Data Analytics student passionate about data visualization, Excel automation, and interactive dashboards. This portfolio is my creative space to keep building and sharing projects as I continue learning and improving.
