# BMW Global Sales 2010-2024 Dashboard Excel 

## Overview

This project analyzes **BMW global vehicle sales** from **2010-2024**, highlighting key trends across regions, models, and various other configurations. 
The dashboard was built using **Microsoft Excel using Power Query**. I also have plans to use **Power Bi** for enhanced interactivity. 

It explores BMW's sales performance through metrics such as
- Total global sales volume (2010-2024)
- Year-over-Year (YoY) growth trends
- Regional and model performance
- ... more coming

## Goal

The goal of this project is to expand on my skills using microsoft excel by practicing and experimenting with different features 
excel has to offer. This project mainly focuses on using power query and power bi to turn large raw datasets into visual gold. The 3 main focus
areas are practicing visuals and design, using power query and power bi, and understanding the data I'm working with. 

## Dataset Description

**Source:** Kaggle -> BMW Global Sales Dataset (2010-2024)

**Rows:** apx. 50,000

**Format:** Aggregate summary data (not individual transactions)

Each row represents a configuration group, not a single sale. Meaning each record shows an average profile
of vehicles with matching specs, along with the total number of units sold. 

### Example Row

| Column               | Example Value | Meaning                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Model                | 5 Series      | Vehicle model                               |
| Year                 | 2016          | Sales year                                  |
| Region               | Asia          | Regional market                             |
| Color                | Red           | Predominant color for this configuration    |
| Fuel Type            | Petrol        | Engine fuel type                            |
| Transmission         | Manual        | Transmission type                           |
| Engine Size (L)      | 3.5           | Engine displacement                         |
| Mileage (KM)         | 151,748       | Average mileage for that configuration      |
| Price (USD)          | 98,740        | Average selling price (estimated)           |
| Sales Volume         | 8,300         | Number of units sold for this configuration |
| Sales Classification | High          | Internal category for sales performance     |

**Notes:**

- Each row represents a vehicle configuration summary (not individual car sale)
- Price and mileage are averages for that configuration.
- Sales volumn reflects the total number of vehicels sold under that configuration.

## Tools used

**Microsoft Excel**
- Power Query for cleaning and aggregating
- PivotTables and formulas for metrics
- Charts for trends

**Planning**
  - Power Bi for interactive dashboard and map visuals

## Project Status

This project is currently a work in progress with alot of upcoming improvements. 

## About the Analysis

This project was built as a part of a personal project of mine to demonstrate:
- Data cleaning and transformation using power query
- Building an aesthetic dashboard with visuals to tell a story with a snapshot.
- Interpret and understand the dataset being worked on
